pfSense:
pf box WAN-IP must be same range as router's IP range (192.168.1.1)
pf LAN set IP static is better. IP range must be diff from router's gateway range (192.168.2.1)
pf DNS must be router's gateway (127.0.0.1 & 192.168.1.1)
All client PCs must point to pf box LAN-IP as DNS (192.168.2.1)
Web GUI can be access via pf BOX WAN/LAN ip

Restrict users to use only pfSense as DNS (redirecting google DNS to pfsense)

Goto >>> Firewall > NAT > Port Forward
Interface: LAN
Protocol: TCP/UDP
Destination: Invert Match checked, LAN Address
Destination Port Range: 53 (DNS)
Redirect Target IP: 127.0.0.1
Redirect Target Port: 53 (DNS)
Description: Redirect DNS
NAT Reflection: Disable

Check DNSBL test : http://fourthgate.org

PORT FORWARDING (Eg NAS:81)
** Steps = Port forward on primary router + pfsense NAT-PortForward + pfsense Firewall rule allow
 
Interface : WAN
Protocol : TCP
Destination : Any
Destination Portrange : 81 (WAN port)
Redirect TargetIP : NAS-IP
Redir Target Port : 81 (Internal port)
NAT Reflection : Disabled
Filter rule association : Pass any to any *OR* let it create new rule itself on WAN interface
