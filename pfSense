pfSense:
pf box WAN-IP must be same range as router's IP range (192.168.1.1)
pf LAN set IP static is better. IP range must be diff from router's gateway range (192.168.2.1)
pf DNS must be router's gateway (127.0.0.1 & 192.168.1.1)
All client PCs must point to pf box LAN-IP as DNS (192.168.2.1)
Web GUI can be access via pf BOX WAN/LAN ip
