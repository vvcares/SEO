*Mounting Google drive as a Virtual drive on ubuntu (Virtual storage): OcamlFuse*

https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alessandro-strada/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install google-drive-ocamlfuse
google-drive-ocamlfuse -headless -label MyFolderName -id MyGdriveClientID -secret MyClientIdSecret

Now we could see the label name 'MyFolderName' is created in the path '/root/.gdfuse/MyFolderName'
Create your 'Gdrive' folder on any location (either root/xxx) or (/home/admin/web/MyDomain.com/public_html/gdrive)
Then the below command will configure the path from the profile of 'MyFolderName'
google-drive-ocamlfuse -label MyFolderName /home/admin/web/MyDomain.com/public_html/gdrive
Now  we have the Gdrive folder, which will auto-sync all the files from the Gdrive account.

To unmount the filesystem, issue this command:
umount /home/admin/web/MyDomain.com/public_html/gdrive
